## Web Application Data Fields

### Sitemap Data

A sitemap is a file that provides information about the pages, videos, and other files on a website and how they are organized. It is used by search engines to better understand the content and structure of a website, which can improve its visibility and ranking in search results.

Sitemaps typically include information such as the URL of each page on the site, when it was last updated, and how frequently it is updated. They can also include additional metadata, such as the importance of the page relative to other pages on the site.

Sitemaps are important for websites with a large number of pages or complex structures, as they can help search engines to better understand the site's organization and hierarchy. They can also be useful for identifying and resolving crawl errors, and for optimizing the site's internal linking structure.

[Sitemap Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map)
### Href Data

SpikeX crawls through the target url and finds all the websites that are in the href tags in the html source code. Domains related to the target is only being displayed and no out-of-scope urls are displayed.

### Robots.txt file contents 
A robots.txt file is a text file that is placed in the root directory of a website and provides instructions to search engine bots on which pages of the site to crawl or not to crawl. It is a tool used by webmasters to control how search engines access and index the content of their site.

The robots.txt file contains a set of rules for search engine crawlers, such as Googlebot, on which pages or directories to ignore or disallow. For example, a webmaster may use a robots.txt file to disallow access to sensitive pages, such as login pages, or to prevent search engines from indexing duplicate content.

It's important to note that while a robots.txt file can provide guidance to search engine bots, it is not a foolproof method for preventing search engines from accessing certain pages. It is possible for search engines to ignore robots.txt directives or for malicious bots to ignore them altogether.

Overall, a robots.txt file is a useful tool for webmasters to control the visibility of their site in search engine results and to prevent sensitive information from being indexed.

[Robots.txt Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt)
#### Robots Allowed

The web application's robots.txt file allows the crawler access the website.

#### Robots Disallowed

The web application's robots.txt file does not allow the crawler access the website.

### HTTP header Data

HTTP headers are pieces of information that are sent between a web server and a client as part of an HTTP request or response. HTTP header data contains metadata about the HTTP message, such as the type and version of the message, the language of the content, the encoding format, and any cookies associated with the request.

HTTP headers can be vulnerable to a variety of attacks and exploits that can compromise the security and privacy of web applications and their users. Here are some common HTTP header vulnerabilities:

Injection attacks: Attackers can manipulate HTTP headers to inject malicious code into web applications or to steal sensitive information, such as user credentials or session tokens.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: Attackers can use certain HTTP headers, such as the Referer header, to inject malicious scripts into web pages and hijack user sessions or steal user data.

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks: Attackers can use HTTP headers to trick users into performing unintended actions on a web application, such as making unauthorized transactions or deleting user data.

Clickjacking attacks: Attackers can use HTTP headers to overlay malicious content on top of legitimate web pages and trick users into clicking on links or buttons that execute unintended actions.

Content Security Policy (CSP) bypasses: Attackers can use certain HTTP headers, such as the Content-Security-Policy header, to bypass CSP protections and execute malicious scripts or access restricted resources.

[HTTP Header Fields List Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields)

[HTTP Header Fields OWASP Vulnerabilities Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html)

### Form tags detected

Form tags in html indicated input pages, potentially login pages. This might be a potential way for the hacker to get an intercation with the target web server. SpikeX counts the number of form tags and find injection points in the web application.

### Shodan Data

Shodan is a search engine that specializes in indexing devices and systems that are connected to the internet. Unlike traditional search engines like Google, Shodan does not search for websites or content on the web, but rather for devices that are connected to the internet, such as servers, routers, webcams, and other IoT devices.

Shodan works by scanning the internet for open ports, which are used by devices to communicate with other devices on the internet. Shodan then indexes the devices that it finds, along with information about the services and applications that they are running, as well as any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may be present.

Users can search for devices on Shodan using a variety of search filters, such as device type, location, operating system, and open ports. This can be useful for researchers, developers, and security professionals who need to identify vulnerable or misconfigured devices on the internet, or who need to gather data about the use of specific technologies or services.

## SpikeX REST API


#### The Power of REST API

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a web-based architectural style for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). A REST API is a web-based API that uses HTTP requests to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE data. REST is based on the principles of client-server architecture, statelessness, and uniform interface.

REST APIs are commonly used for web services that allow external applications to interact with a web application or database. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to send and receive data, making them platform and language independent. This makes it easy for developers to create applications that can communicate with any REST API.

#### How SpikeX is charged with REST API
SpikeX aims to contribute to the projects of other developers and add more value to their hard written code. SpikeX provides completely open and free REST API that can be accessed without any API KEY. This makes it easier for the developer to plug and play the SpikeX functionalites. 

#### Usage:

Visit [SpikeX API PAGE](http://spikex.co/api)

Send a GET request to
```
http://spikex.co/api?url=<target_url>&mode=<mode>
```

#### Available modes: 

* href_spider
* sitemap
* http_header_data
* allow_robots
* disallow_robots
* form_count
* dir_enum
* sub_enum

#### Response to the GET Request 

SpikeX responds to the GET Request of the API page with proper parameters set with data in JSON format. This makes the data managable and easy to handle for the developers. 

#### What about spooky errors?

SpikeX return as error in JSON format to the developer. This allows the developer to configure the code in a way that the errors can be managed.
